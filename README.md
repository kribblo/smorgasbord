## Smorgasbord - a buffet of useful table functionalities and a semantic library to tie them together

WORK IN PROGRESS, COME BACK LATER

Smorgasbord is a buffet of commonly useful table manipulations, such as sorting, filtering and pagination. Unlike most other similar libraries, it's
completely CSS agnostic, works with pure standard table HTML and does not unduly alter the original table, nor is any UI auto-generated.

Each functionality comes as a tiny js file that can be included on it's own, with no external dependencies and called with a table as input.

There will also be a larger library encompassing all the functionalities, that can be configured with semantic class names as well.
